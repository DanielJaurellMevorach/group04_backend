# group04_backend

In this repository, there is no active code outside the functions folder. The code within the functions folder is already deployed on Azure, and a pipeline is set up to automatically deploy any changes from this folder to Azure, so no additional configuration is required here.

The remaining code represents a previous version of the project when we maintained a backend server. The project has since been fully converted to use Azure Functions, eliminating the need for a separate backend.
